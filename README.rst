QISKit - Jupyter Notebooks
==========================

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating quantum
computing using QISKit, the open source quantum information software
developer's toolkit. They provide an excellent way to learn,
contribute, and collaborate on topics in quantum computing.

Organization
------------
The notebooks are organized into several categories

1. Introduction to the tools
2. Exploring quantum information concepts
3. Verification tools for quantum information science
4. Applications of short-depth quantum circuits on quantum computers
5. Quantum games

For further information checkout out the Jupyter notebook index.ipynb
at the top of this repo.

Installation and setup
----------------------

1. Install the the necessary software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install, simply clone this repo, ``cd`` into the directory, and run

.. code:: sh

    make conda

To setup the API token:

1. Create an `IBM Quantum Experience Experience <https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net>` account if you haven't already done so
2. Get an API token from the Quantum Experience website under "My Account" > "Personal Access Token"
3. You will insert your API token into a new ``secret.txt`` file at the root of this tutorial.  It is read by the ``Qconfig.py`` file.  Don't worry: it is ignored by ``.gitignore``.

To startup jupyter, run

.. code:: sh

    make jupyter

2. Explore the tutorials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a terminal window copy or link your Qconfig.py file from step (1)
into this directory.

- Linux, macOS: ``cp /path/to/Qconfig.py qiskit-tutorial``
- Windows: ``copy \path\to\Qconfig.py qiskit-tutorial``

Go to the ``qiskit-tutorial`` directory.

.. code:: sh

    cd qiskit-tutorial

Start Jupyter with the index notebook.

.. code:: sh

    jupyter notebook index.ipynb


Contributing
------------

If you would like to contribute to the tutorials there are a number of
ways to get involved.

Issue Reporting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issues can be reported with GitHub `issue reporting
<https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial/issues>`__ for this
repo. Select ``New issue`` and fill in a descriptive title and provide
as much detail as is needed for the issue to be reproduced.

Please check the
`wiki <https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial/wiki/QISKit-Tutorials>`__
for frequently asked questions and notes about common issues.

Notebooks
~~~~~~~~~

If you would like to contribute a notebook please create a `fork
<https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/>`__ of the repository
and create a `pull request
<https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/>`__ for your
change. To help with the review of your change it would be good to
include a detailed description of the contribution and a unit test
(e.g. using python's ``unittest`` framework). Notebooks being submitted to
the ``contrib`` directory will allow for the notebook to be part of
the repo while they are being vetted by the community.

Branch convention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please note that this repository contains two branches:

- the ``stable`` branch contains tutorials that are meant to be compatible
  with the `latest stable release of
  QISKit <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/qiskit>`__.
- the ``master`` branch contains tutorials that are meant to be compatible
  with the `latest development version of
  QISKIT <https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-sdk-py>`__. Please note that this
  branch includes features that might still not be ready for production, and
  requires that you install the SDK using git and keep up to date with the
  daily updates.

If you experience problems, please revise that the versions of the packages
installed on your system match the ones specified at the bottom of each
tutorial.

Using IBM DSx for your notebooks
---------------------------------
IBM Data Science Experience (DSx) is a platform where you can interactively 
run your quantum programs, collaborate and share your work with others. 

Among other things, it provides a ready-to-use environment to run Jupyter 
Python notebooks. For someone just getting started with QISkit, this is an 
excellent option. You can skip all the installation and environment creation 
steps on your computer, and instead use this web-hosted Jupyter notebook 
environment for running the Quantum programs. It also provides a platform 
where you can invite fellow researchers to collaborate on the notebooks 
you have developed or simply share your work within the community.

We have customized the example notebooks for you, so that you can 
directly run those using DSx. To get started, refer to this 
example: `1_introduction/running_on_IBM_DSX.ipynb`

See this `link
<https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial/wiki/Running-Quantum-Program-on-IBM-DSx>`__ 
that gives step-by-step instructions on setting up an example notebook on DSx.
